CODING EXERCISE

This is my first JavaScript and TypeScript API.  The APIs that I've written previously were all
in Python.  That being said, I hope that I was able to meet the acceptance criteria.  I was a little confused
about the requests for this exercise, specifically that it couldn't be a web API or use any data storage or retrieval.
There are calls out to a json placeholder site, which does unfortunately make this a web API.

Given that there are calls out to an external API grabbing some dummy data, my interfaces needed to accommodate
the data types expected.  There are a few things that I would spend more time on for this project, however I wanted to
get something in for you before too long.

Ideally, the preferredCarrierService would be a Boolean value that is set to either True or False.  If a dispensary
tried to update the carrierService assigned to a dispensary, and it was set to True, there would be an error message
returned.  This API is pretty simple and doesn't allow for some requirements asked for, I hope that this is
acceptable as it's my very first JS/TS API.
